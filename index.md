__Wax__ is a [minimal computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/) project for producing digital exhibitions focused on longevity, low costs, and flexibility. Our underlying technology is made to learn and to teach, and can produce beautifully rendered, high-quality image collections and scholarly exhibits. To start using Wax, please see our [documentation](https://minicomp.github.io/wiki/#/wax/) for installation instructions and more.

This test site's sample collection comprises a set of screenshots from Paul Thomas Anderson's 2008 film *There Will Be Blood*.
